  Sandboxed Claude Code  ·
  "It's my industrial-strength hair dryer, AND IT WORKS."
```

A sandboxed Docker container for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with an iptables firewall.
Your code stays on the host, VS Code sees changes instantly, and Claude stays in his room.

## What he can reach

| Domain | Why |
|---|---|
| `api.anthropic.com` | His brain |
| `registry.npmjs.org` | npm packages |
| `sentry.io` | Telemetry |
| `statsig.anthropic.com` / `statsig.com` | Telemetry |

Everything else is blocked. He'll get an immediate REJECT if he tries.

## Prerequisites (macOS, from scratch)

You need three things: Homebrew, Docker CLI tools, and Colima (a lightweight Docker runtime — no Docker Desktop, no GUI, no license fees).

### 1. Install Homebrew

If you don't have it yet:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the instructions it prints at the end to add `brew` to your PATH. For Apple Silicon Macs this is usually:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

### 2. Install Docker + Colima

```bash
brew install docker docker-buildx colima
```

This installs:
- `docker` — the CLI client (no daemon, just the command)
- `docker-buildx` — the build plugin (required for `docker build`)
- `colima` — a lightweight Linux VM that runs the Docker daemon

### 3. Configure the buildx plugin

Docker needs to know where Homebrew installed the buildx plugin:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.docker
echo '{"cliPluginsExtraDirs": ["/opt/homebrew/lib/docker/cli-plugins"]}' > ~/.docker/config.json
```

> **Note:** If you already have a `~/.docker/config.json` with other settings, merge the `cliPluginsExtraDirs` key into it manually instead of overwriting the file.

### [Optional] 4. Get an Anthropic API key

Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) and create an API key. A dedicated key for Mister Claude is recommended so you can revoke it independently.

## Setup

1. **Clone this repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:aisaacs/mrc.git
   cd mister-claude
   ```

2. [Optional] **Create the `.env` file** in the repo root

   ```bash
   echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." > .env
   ```

   Replace `sk-ant-...` with your actual key. This file is gitignored.

3. **Add `mrc` to your PATH:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x mrc
   sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/mrc" /usr/local/bin/mrc
   ```

   This creates a symlink so you can run `mrc` from anywhere.

## Usage

```bash
# Open a project
mrc ~/projects/my-app

# Pass arguments to Claude Code after --
mrc ~/projects/my-app -- -p "refactor the auth module"
mrc ~/projects/my-app -- --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

# Current directory
mrc .

# Verbose mode (shows Colima and Docker output)
mrc -v ~/projects/my-app
```

First run builds the Docker image (~2 min). After that it's ready in about 5 seconds while the firewall sets up.

When you quit Claude, the container disappears. Your files are safe on the host — only the container is ephemeral.

Claude's global config (auth, settings, plugins) is persisted in a per-repo Docker volume (`mrc-config-<hash>`) between runs. Project-specific data (memory, conversation history, project settings) is stored in `.mrc/` inside the repo itself — it survives volume resets and travels with the project.

Sessions auto-resume: when you re-open the same repo, Claude picks up where you left off. To start fresh, pass `-- --no-continue` or delete `.mrc/`.

## Keeping secrets from Mister Claude

Create a `.sandboxignore` file in the root of the repo you're mounting:

```
# Secrets
.env
.env.local
.env.production

# Infrastructure
terraform/
k8s/
secrets/
```

- **Files** are masked with `/dev/null` (appear empty inside the container)
- **Directories** get an anonymous volume overlay (appear as empty directories)
- Comments (`#`) and blank lines are supported

He doesn't know what he's missing.

## Data persistence

Mister Claude stores data in two places:

**Per-repo Docker volume** (`mrc-config-<hash>`) — holds global Claude config: auth state, global settings, installed plugins. Each repo gets its own volume (keyed by MD5 hash of the repo path) so projects don't contaminate each other. The volume name is shown in the banner at startup.

**`.mrc/` in your repo** — holds project-specific Claude data: memory, conversation history, project settings. This directory is:
- Auto-created on first run
- Auto-added to `.gitignore`
- Symlinked from `~/.claude/projects/-workspace/` inside the container

Because `.mrc/` lives in the repo, it survives volume resets and travels with the project if you move or clone it. To start fresh, just `rm -rf .mrc/`.

To nuke the volume for a repo:

```bash
# Find the volume name (shown in the mrc banner, or:)
docker volume ls | grep mrc-config

# Remove it
docker volume rm mrc-config-<hash>
```

## Letting him visit new places

Edit the domain list in `init-firewall.sh`:

```bash
for domain in \
    "registry.npmjs.org" \
    "api.anthropic.com" \
    "sentry.io" \
    "statsig.anthropic.com" \
    "statsig.com" \
    "your-private-registry.com"; do   # ← add your own here
```

Then force a rebuild:

```bash
docker rmi mister-claude
```

The next `mrc` run will rebuild the image with the new firewall rules.

## How it works

1. `mrc` resolves the repo path, auto-starts Colima if needed, builds the Docker image, reads `.sandboxignore`, creates a per-repo config volume (`mrc-config-<hash>`), and starts the container with the repo bind-mounted at `/workspace`
2. The container runs as a non-root `coder` user with UID/GID matching your host user (no permission weirdness with bind-mounted files)
3. `entrypoint.sh` waits for the network, then runs `init-firewall.sh` via passwordless sudo
4. The firewall resolves each allowed domain to IPs, adds them to an `ipset`, sets the default iptables policy to DROP, and verifies that `example.com` is unreachable
5. The entrypoint symlinks Claude's project store into `/workspace/.mrc/` so memory and project data persist in the repo
6. Claude Code starts with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — the container is the security boundary, so Claude can freely run commands inside it
7. VS Code on the host sees all file changes instantly via the bind mount

## Customization

**More system tools** — add packages to the `apt-get install` line in the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    curl \
    ca-certificates \
    ripgrep \
    sudo \
    iptables \
    ipset \
    iproute2 \
    dnsutils \
    python3 \        # ← add what you need
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

**Different Node version** — change the base image in the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-slim    # or node:18-slim, etc.
```

**More resources for Colima:**

```bash
colima stop
colima start --vm-type vz --mount-type virtiofs --cpu 6 --memory 16
```

**Let him run free** (no firewall) — replace the ENTRYPOINT in the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["claude", "--dangerously-skip-permissions"]
```

## Clipboard (image paste)

Text paste works out of the box (it travels through the terminal as stdin), but pasting images requires a clipboard bridge between the host and the container. Mister Claude ships one — a small TCP proxy that lets the container read your host clipboard.

### Prerequisites

Install `socat` on the host:

```bash
# macOS
brew install socat

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install socat
```

### How it works

1. `mrc` starts `clipboard-proxy.sh` on the host, listening on `127.0.0.1:7722`
2. Inside the container, a shim installed at `/usr/local/bin/xclip` intercepts Claude Code's clipboard reads
3. The shim connects to the proxy via `host.docker.internal:7722` and fetches clipboard data over TCP

The banner will show `Clipboard: the Schwartz can see your clipboard` when the proxy is running.

### Usage

Just copy an image to your clipboard on the host and press **Ctrl+V** inside Claude Code. That's it.

### Troubleshooting clipboard

**Banner doesn't show the clipboard line** — Make sure `socat` is installed on the host. The proxy won't start without it.

**"No image found in clipboard"** — Try these steps:

1. From the host (separate terminal), verify the proxy is responding:

   ```bash
   echo "GET TARGETS" | socat - TCP:127.0.0.1:7722
   # Should print "text/plain" (and "image/png" if an image is copied)
   ```

2. From inside the container, verify connectivity:

   ```bash
   printf 'GET TARGETS\n' | socat -,ignoreeof TCP:host.docker.internal:7722
   ```

3. Check the shim logs inside the container:

   ```bash
   cat /tmp/mrc-xclip-shim.log
   ```

4. Host-side proxy logs appear in the terminal where `mrc` is running (stderr).

**"No route to host" in shim logs** — The firewall may be blocking traffic to `host.docker.internal`. Rebuild the image (`docker rmi mister-claude`) to pick up the latest firewall rules that allow this route.

## Troubleshooting

**`docker: command not found`** — Run `brew install docker docker-buildx colima` and make sure Homebrew is on your PATH.

**`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`** — Colima isn't running. Start it with `colima start --vm-type vz --mount-type virtiofs --cpu 4 --memory 8`.

**`ERROR: Network not ready after 30 attempts`** — The container couldn't resolve DNS. Try `colima stop && colima start --vm-type vz --mount-type virtiofs --cpu 4 --memory 8` to restart the VM.

**`ERROR: Firewall verification failed`** — The iptables rules didn't take effect. Make sure the container has `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_RAW` (this is handled by `mrc` automatically).

**Permission errors on mounted files** — The Docker image builds with your UID/GID. If you see permission issues, rebuild: `docker rmi mister-claude` and run `mrc` again.

**`✗ Auto-update failed`** — Claude Code's version is baked into the Docker image at build time and auto-update is disabled inside the container. If you see this error, your image is stale. Rebuild it:

```bash
docker rmi mister-claude
mrc ~/projects/my-app
```

This pulls the latest Claude Code from npm and builds a fresh image.

**Slow file access** — Make sure you started Colima with `--mount-type virtiofs`. If you started it without that flag, stop and restart with the full flags.
