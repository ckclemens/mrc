  Sandboxed Claude Code  ·
  "It's my industrial-strength hair dryer, AND IT WORKS."
```

A sandboxed Docker container for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with an iptables firewall.
Your code stays on the host, VS Code sees changes instantly, and Claude stays in his room.

## What he can reach

| Domain | Why |
|---|---|
| `api.anthropic.com` | His brain |
| `registry.npmjs.org` | npm packages |
| `sentry.io` | Telemetry |
| `statsig.anthropic.com` / `statsig.com` | Telemetry |

Everything else is blocked. He'll get an immediate REJECT if he tries.

## Prerequisites (macOS, from scratch)

You need two things: Homebrew and OrbStack (a fast, self-managing Docker runtime for macOS — no Docker Desktop, no GUI wrangling, no license fees). OrbStack ships its own `docker` CLI and buildx plugin, so nothing else is needed for the container runtime itself.

### 1. Install Homebrew

If you don't have it yet:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the instructions it prints at the end to add `brew` to your PATH. For Apple Silicon Macs this is usually:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

### 2. Install OrbStack + host tools

```bash
brew install orbstack socat terminal-notifier
```

Then open OrbStack from Applications once so it can install its CLI tools and start the Docker daemon. You'll see a green "running" indicator in the menu bar when it's ready.

- `orbstack` — the Docker runtime (also provides the `docker` CLI and buildx)
- `socat` — used by the clipboard and notification proxies
- `terminal-notifier` — used for desktop notifications on macOS

### [Optional] 3. Get an Anthropic API key

Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) and create an API key. A dedicated key for Mister Claude is recommended so you can revoke it independently.

## Setup

1. **Clone this repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:aisaacs/mrc.git
   cd mister-claude
   ```

2. [Optional] **Create the `.env` file** in the repo root

   ```bash
   echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." > .env
   ```

   Replace `sk-ant-...` with your actual key. This file is gitignored.

3. **Add `mrc` to your PATH:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x mrc
   sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/mrc" /usr/local/bin/mrc
   ```

   This creates a symlink so you can run `mrc` from anywhere.

## Usage

```bash
# Open a project
mrc ~/projects/my-app

# Pass arguments to Claude Code after --
mrc ~/projects/my-app -- -p "refactor the auth module"
mrc ~/projects/my-app -- --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

# Current directory
mrc .

# Verbose mode (shows Docker output)
mrc -v ~/projects/my-app
```

First run builds the Docker image (~2 min). After that it's ready in about 5 seconds while the firewall sets up.

When you quit Claude, the container disappears. Your files are safe on the host — only the container is ephemeral.

Claude's global config (auth, settings, plugins) is persisted in a per-repo Docker volume (`mrc-config-<hash>`) between runs. Project-specific data (memory, conversation history, project settings) is stored in `.mrc/` inside the repo itself — it survives volume resets and travels with the project.

Sessions auto-resume: when you re-open the same repo, Claude picks up where you left off. To start a new conversation instead, use `mrc --new`.

## Sessions

Each conversation is saved in `.mrc/` and can be listed, named, and resumed.

```bash
# Start a new named session
mrc --new fix-bug-42

# Start a new unnamed session
mrc --new

# List sessions
mrc sessions ls

# Name the most recent session
mrc sessions name "auth-refactor"

# Name a specific session by number
mrc sessions name "clipboard-fix" 2

# Resume a session by name or number
mrc sessions resume auth-refactor
mrc sessions resume 2
```

## Keeping secrets from Mister Claude

Create a `.sandboxignore` file in the root of the repo you're mounting:

```
# Secrets
.env
.env.local
.env.production

# Infrastructure
terraform/
k8s/
secrets/
```

- **Files** are masked with `/dev/null` (appear empty inside the container)
- **Directories** get an anonymous volume overlay (appear as empty directories)
- Comments (`#`) and blank lines are supported

He doesn't know what he's missing.

## Data persistence

Mister Claude stores data in two places:

**Per-repo Docker volume** (`mrc-config-<hash>`) — holds global Claude config: auth state, global settings, installed plugins. Each repo gets its own volume (keyed by MD5 hash of the repo path) so projects don't contaminate each other. The volume name is shown in the banner at startup.

**`.mrc/` in your repo** — holds project-specific Claude data: memory, conversation history, project settings. This directory is:
- Auto-created on first run
- Auto-added to `.gitignore`
- Symlinked from `~/.claude/projects/-workspace/` inside the container

Because `.mrc/` lives in the repo, it survives volume resets and travels with the project if you move or clone it. To start fresh, just `rm -rf .mrc/`.

To nuke the volume for a repo:

```bash
# Find the volume name (shown in the mrc banner, or:)
docker volume ls | grep mrc-config

# Remove it
docker volume rm mrc-config-<hash>
```

## Letting him visit new places

Edit the domain list in `init-firewall.sh`:

```bash
for domain in \
    "registry.npmjs.org" \
    "api.anthropic.com" \
    "sentry.io" \
    "statsig.anthropic.com" \
    "statsig.com" \
    "your-private-registry.com"; do   # ← add your own here
```

Then force a rebuild:

```bash
docker rmi mister-claude
```

The next `mrc` run will rebuild the image with the new firewall rules.

## How it works

1. `mrc` resolves the repo path, verifies the Docker daemon is reachable via `docker info` (OrbStack manages the daemon automatically on macOS), builds the Docker image, reads `.sandboxignore`, creates a per-repo config volume (`mrc-config-<hash>`), and starts the container with the repo bind-mounted at `/workspace`
2. The container runs as a non-root `coder` user with UID/GID matching your host user (no permission weirdness with bind-mounted files)
3. `entrypoint.sh` waits for the network, then runs `init-firewall.sh` via passwordless sudo
4. The firewall resolves each allowed domain to IPs, adds them to an `ipset`, sets the default iptables policy to DROP, and verifies that `example.com` is unreachable
5. The entrypoint symlinks Claude's project store into `/workspace/.mrc/` so memory and project data persist in the repo
6. Claude Code starts with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — the container is the security boundary, so Claude can freely run commands inside it
7. VS Code on the host sees all file changes instantly via the bind mount

## Customization

**More system tools** — add packages to the `apt-get install` line in the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    curl \
    ca-certificates \
    ripgrep \
    sudo \
    iptables \
    ipset \
    iproute2 \
    dnsutils \
    python3 \        # ← add what you need
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

**Different Node version** — change the base image in the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-slim    # or node:18-slim, etc.
```

**More resources for OrbStack** — open the OrbStack menu bar app → **Settings** → **System** and adjust the CPU and memory sliders. Changes apply on the next container start; no CLI flags needed.

**Let him run free** (no firewall) — replace the ENTRYPOINT in the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["claude", "--dangerously-skip-permissions"]
```

## Clipboard (image paste)

Text paste works out of the box (it travels through the terminal as stdin), but pasting images requires a clipboard bridge between the host and the container. Mister Claude ships one — a small TCP proxy that lets the container read your host clipboard.

### Prerequisites

Install `socat` on the host:

```bash
# macOS
brew install socat

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install socat
```

### How it works

1. `mrc` starts `clipboard-proxy.sh` on the host, listening on `127.0.0.1:7722`
2. Inside the container, a shim installed at `/usr/local/bin/xclip` intercepts Claude Code's clipboard reads
3. The shim connects to the proxy via `host.docker.internal:7722` and fetches clipboard data over TCP

The banner will show `Clipboard: the Schwartz can see your clipboard` when the proxy is running.

### Usage

Just copy an image to your clipboard on the host and press **Ctrl+V** inside Claude Code. That's it.

### Troubleshooting clipboard

**Banner doesn't show the clipboard line** — Make sure `socat` is installed on the host. The proxy won't start without it.

**"No image found in clipboard"** — Try these steps:

1. From the host (separate terminal), verify the proxy is responding:

   ```bash
   echo "GET TARGETS" | socat - TCP:127.0.0.1:7722
   # Should print "text/plain" (and "image/png" if an image is copied)
   ```

2. From inside the container, verify connectivity:

   ```bash
   printf 'GET TARGETS\n' | socat -,ignoreeof TCP:host.docker.internal:7722
   ```

3. Check the shim logs inside the container:

   ```bash
   cat /tmp/mrc-xclip-shim.log
   ```

4. Host-side proxy logs appear in the terminal where `mrc` is running (stderr).

**"No route to host" in shim logs** — The firewall may be blocking traffic to `host.docker.internal`. Rebuild the image (`docker rmi mister-claude`) to pick up the latest firewall rules that allow this route.

## Notifications

Mister Claude sends a desktop notification whenever Claude needs your attention — when he finishes a response, when he asks for permission to run a tool, and when he shows the plan approval prompt. Work in another window and he'll tap you on the shoulder when he needs you.

### Prerequisites

Install `terminal-notifier` and `socat` on the host:

```bash
brew install terminal-notifier socat
```

### Do Not Disturb

Notifications come from the **terminal-notifier** app. To let them through macOS Focus / Do Not Disturb:

1. **System Settings** → **Focus** → **Do Not Disturb**
2. **Allowed Notifications** → **Apps** → **Add** → select **terminal-notifier**

### Options

```bash
mrc --no-notify ~/projects/my-app   # disable notifications entirely
mrc --no-sound ~/projects/my-app    # notifications without the Glass sound
```

### Troubleshooting notifications

**Notifications appear in Notification Center but not on screen** — The notification style is set to "None". Go to **System Settings** → **Notifications** → find **terminal-notifier** → set the style to **Banners** (auto-dismiss) or **Alerts** (stay until dismissed).

**No notifications while screen sharing or mirroring** — macOS suppresses notifications during screen sharing by default. Go to **System Settings** → **Notifications** → **Show Notifications** → set **"when mirroring or sharing the display"** to **Allow Notifications**.

**Two terminal-notifier entries in notification settings** — This is a known quirk. One is typically from Homebrew, the other from a previous install or a bundled copy. Make sure both have notifications enabled and the style set to Banners or Alerts.

**Notifications not appearing at all** — macOS may silently block `terminal-notifier` on first use. Go to **System Settings** → **Notifications** → find **terminal-notifier** → make sure **Allow Notifications** is toggled on.

**Quick test from the host** — Run this to verify `terminal-notifier` works outside of mrc:

```bash
terminal-notifier -title "Mr. Claude · test" -message "Ready for input." -sound Glass
```

If nothing appears, check the settings above. If you see an error, make sure it's installed (`brew install terminal-notifier`).

## Troubleshooting

**`docker: command not found`** — OrbStack provides the `docker` CLI. Make sure OrbStack is installed (`brew install orbstack`) and that you opened it at least once so it could wire up its CLI tools.

**`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`** — OrbStack isn't running. Open OrbStack from your Applications folder and wait for the green "running" indicator in the menu bar.

**`ERROR: Network not ready after 30 attempts`** — The container couldn't resolve DNS. Quit and relaunch OrbStack from the menu bar to restart the VM, then try `mrc` again.

**`ERROR: Firewall verification failed`** — The iptables rules didn't take effect. Make sure the container has `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_RAW` (this is handled by `mrc` automatically).

**Permission errors on mounted files** — The Docker image builds with your UID/GID. If you see permission issues, rebuild: `docker rmi mister-claude` and run `mrc` again.

**`✗ Auto-update failed`** — Claude Code's version is baked into the Docker image at build time and auto-update is disabled inside the container. If you see this error, your image is stale. Rebuild it:

```bash
docker rmi mister-claude
mrc ~/projects/my-app
```

This pulls the latest Claude Code from npm and builds a fresh image.

**Slow file access** — OrbStack uses VirtioFS for bind mounts by default on Apple Silicon, so this is rarely an issue. If you're seeing genuine slowness, check OrbStack → Settings → File Sharing to confirm the repo's parent directory is on the shared list.
